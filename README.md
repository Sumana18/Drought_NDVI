# Drought Analysis using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Study of Drought and Variation of Vegetation using Python Programming: Case Study of Pune 

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). NDVI  ranges from  -1 to +1. NDVI thresholds used toclassify  various features are as follows: 
* Healthy vegetation: > 0.6 
* Normal vegetation/grassland: 0.2 – 0.6 
* Soil/Barren Land/Rocks: 0.1 – 0.2 
* Water: -0.2 – 0.1 
* Others like clouds: < -0.2
